UTooL is an Android-Java project with the goal of providing a quick to set up and easy to use tournament management system.

No lengthy set up process is required - provide your name and the tournament type and you can start the tournament!  From there, wait for players to connect or add them yourself.  Keeping track of scores and standings is made simple, and anyone with an Android device within range can connect to your tournament and follow along.

UTooL was developed for Android with a plugin-architecture designed to allow for almost unlimited expansion to support any tournament type that you want to manage.  Currently, Single Elimination, Swiss, King of the Hill, and Round Robin plug ins have been developed.  Give them a try!

To get started developing your own UTooL plug ins, see our developer documentation in the Wiki.
